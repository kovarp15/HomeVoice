HomeVoice Android App v0.1.0
============================

Do you remember Iron Man's personal assistant called J.A.R.V.I.S.? It is just a fictional technology from movie, but HomeVoice is real. HomeVoice will become your personal voice controlled assistant. Main task of HomeVoice is to control your smart home (based on Z-Wave technology). Currently it supports Z-Way, the very first Z-Wave control software certified by the Z-Way Alliance.

HomeVoice has been created by Petr Kovář as his final thesis at CTU in Prague.

Based on [Android UI for Z-Way](https://github.com/Z-Wave-Me/Z-Way-Android/tree/develop)
